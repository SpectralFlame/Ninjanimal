# Ninjanimal

Reach the 4 Ninjanimals and learn how to reach the golden dragon high in the skies.

## Rules

### Start of the game

Each player will be given a clan at random and starts at clan's base land with 2 workers.

Resource Starter Pack:
* 3 wood
* 3 stone
* 3 horns
* 3 wool
* 10 food

The player might get extra workers, soldiers or resources to start with depending on what clan they got.

### Turn Composition

There are 4 different turn compositions, move, harvest, build or trade. all steps are optional for each of these compositions.

#### Move Composition
1. Move
2. Battle (mandatory if needed)

#### Trade Composition

### Moving your animals

Moving animals happens in groups, wether it'd be workers or soldiers. a worker group consists out of 3 or fewer workers. a soldier group consists out of 10 or fewer soldiers.

Workers always have a speed of 1, except when you are from the Rabbit Clan and your workers are rabbits, they have a speed of 2. If a group consists of 2 rabbits and a cow, the speed of the cow is used.

Soldier groups move with the average speed (rounded down) of the group.

Carts can be used to move a group of soldiers and up to 3 groups of workers together when all of these groups start from the same tile. a worker group can't be picked up along the way. The move depends on the speed of the soldiers. This counts as a single move.

Bridges can be built over the river that borders your beginning land. You can only use your own bridges to get to new lands.
